# Go Microservices Project

## Overview

This repository is a demo project and contains two microservices: `user` and `auth`, which communicate via gRPC. The `user` service utilizes a MySQL database, and the `auth` service is built on top of a Cassandra database. The `auth` service is designed following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
